# Future Feature Roadmap for QP-QK SDK

## Overview

This document outlines potential future enhancements and features for the QP-QK SDK. These features would expand the SDK's capabilities for both AI agents and human developers, making embedded development more efficient, accessible, and powerful.

## Existing QTools Coverage

The [Quantum Leaps QTools collection](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qtools) already provides several tools that partially address some planned enhancements:

### Already Available in QTools:
- **qspy**: Real-time tracing (covers basic debugging and monitoring needs)
- **qutest**: Trace-based testing framework (covers some testing requirements)
- **qview**: Real-time visualization (partial coverage of performance visualization)
- **qwin**: GUI prototyping for Windows (helps with HMI development)
- **qfsgen**: ROM filesystem generator (useful for embedded web interfaces)
- **Unity**: Unit testing framework (covers basic unit testing needs)

### Gaps to Address:
The existing tools provide a foundation, but the planned enhancements would extend beyond current capabilities in areas like AI integration, web-based development, advanced debugging, and platform expansion.

## QTools Integration Strategy

### Building on Existing Tools:
1. **Enhanced Debugging (Feature #4)** - Extend qspy with AI analysis and time-travel capabilities

3. **Testing Framework (Features #15-16)** - Extend qutest with mutation testing and HIL support
4. **HMI Development (Feature #18)** - Use qwin for rapid prototyping before target deployment
5. **Performance Analysis (Feature #11)** - Layer analytics on top of qspy/qview data streams
6. **State Machine Design** - Import/export compatibility with QM models; add collaboration layer
