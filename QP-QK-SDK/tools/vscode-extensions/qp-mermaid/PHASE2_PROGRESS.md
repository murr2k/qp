# Phase 2 Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

### ✅ Mermaid Preprocessor
- Converts QP-specific syntax to Mermaid-compatible format
- Preserves QP metadata in comments for code generation
- Handles entry/exit actions, guards, and internal transitions

### ✅ Hierarchical State Machine Support
- Full support for composite states with proper nesting
- Automatic initial transition setup for composite states
- Hierarchical state name resolution (e.g., On.Operand1)
- LCA (Least Common Ancestor) calculation for transitions

### ✅ Enhanced Parser
- Hierarchical state parser with scope resolution
- Support for dot notation in state paths
- Proper parent-child relationship handling

### ✅ Advanced Code Generator
- Generates code for hierarchical states with proper naming
- Converts dot notation to C-compatible identifiers (On.Operand1 → On_Operand1)
- Proper Q_SUPER handling for state hierarchy

### ✅ State Machine Validation
- Comprehensive validation with error/warning/info levels
- Checks for:
  - Unreachable states
  - Missing initial transitions
  - Duplicate state names
  - Invalid transitions
  - QP naming conventions
  - Guard condition syntax
- Real-time diagnostics in VS Code
- Validation on save

### ✅ Complex Examples
- Calculator state machine with nested states and guards
- Toaster oven with orthogonal regions and safety features

## Architecture Improvements

### Preprocessor Pipeline
```
QP Syntax → Preprocessor → Mermaid Syntax → Visual Preview
     ↓                            ↓
  Parser → Code Generator → QP/C Code
```

### Module Structure
```

├── preprocessor/
│   └── mermaidPreprocessor.ts    # QP→Mermaid conversion
├── parser/
│   ├── qpMermaidParser.ts        # Main parser
│   └── hierarchicalStateParser.ts # HSM support
├── generator/

└── commands/
    └── validateCommand.ts        # Validation integration
```

## What's Working Now

1. **Visual Preview**: QP-specific syntax is preprocessed so Mermaid can render it
2. **Code Generation**: Fully supports hierarchical states, guards, and actions
3. **Validation**: Comprehensive checking with VS Code diagnostics
4. **Complex State Machines**: Can handle real-world examples like calculators

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] IntelliSense support for QP keywords
- [ ] Unit tests for all modules

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Custom webview editor with drag-and-drop
- [ ] QM file import/export

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Simulation capabilities
- [ ] Debugging integration
- [ ] Multi-file support

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Bidirectional Syntax Support**: Write in QP syntax, see in Mermaid, generate proper code
2. **Full HSM Support**: Proper handling of composite states and transitions
3. **Production-Ready Validation**: Catches common errors before compilation
4. **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new features and validations

The extension has evolved from a proof-of-concept to a powerful development tool that bridges modern web tooling with embedded systems development.
